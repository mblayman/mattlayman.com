I’m Matt, a software creator. Here are things I do:


## Build apps on YouTube

I'm regularly streaming on {{< extlink "https://www.youtube.com/c/MattLayman/live" "YouTube" >}}.
On most Wednesday nights at 9pm Eastern time,
I'm streaming on YouTube
to build a Django application.
My primary goal is to teach others how to build complex web projects
and all the skills that they'll need to produce something
that's more than a tutorial app.

Want to check it out?
I post the streams on YouTube
at the {{< extlink "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzDsImiO7b8&list=PLFcKEo4b_n1wQA6lKtSqCq1dTMq1c2Lmw" "Building SaaS with Python and Django" >}} playlist.

## Frederick Technology

Frederick is a lovely small city
to the Northwest
of Washington, D.C.
I'm involved
in the technology scene
to find community
and foster a love of tech
among my fellow citizens.

* I started
  {{< extlink "https://www.pythonfrederick.org/" "Python Frederick" >}}
  in 2015
  and continue to organize it
  (with some fantastic co-organizers).
* I helped coordinate the city's first
  {{< extlink "https://www.hackfrederick.com/" "Hackathon" >}}.
* Through my efforts
  on a team of tech volunteers,
  we earned Frederick a finalist spot
  in Amazon's
  {{< extlink "https://aws.amazon.com/stateandlocal/cityonacloud/2017finalists/" "2017 City on a Cloud Innovation Challenge" >}}.

I care deeply about my home,
and I push hard to make sure
that its citizens have the opportunity to learn
about technology.

I’m currently a senior staff software engineer
at {{< extlink "https://includedhealth.com/" "Included Health" >}}.
Included Health connects patients to doctors
with video calls
to solve common health problems.
I write code using Django (and Go)
to make the patient experience
as good as it can be.

I worked at <a href="https://storybird.com" target="_blank">Storybird</a>.
Storybird makes it possible for people to share creative stories
through book and poetry writing.
I was the lead software engineer
with the opportunity to make Storybird an even better place to share stories.
I got to write Python and JavaScript every day
and help make the internet more awesome.

<a href="https://lockheedmartin.com/" target="_blank">Lockheed Martin</a> was my employer.
While there, I worked on a wide range of products.
You might have heard of some of them,
like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System#Control_segment" target="_blank">GPS</a>
or <a href="https://www.iridium.com/network/iridium-next/" target="_blank">satellite phones</a>.
I also gained experience with Modeling and Simulation software,
web applications,
and complex configuration management.

## Family

I am a family man.
I consider myself blessed to have a loving wife, Elease, and
two great kids, Mark and Faye.
My children are young so my life is a
little hectic, but that's perfectly fine with me.

## Church

I am a Christian, and I attend <a href="http://newhopeopc.org/" target="_blank">New Hope OPC</a>.
My hope is that my faith reflects on all of my behavior, and that I show kindness,
humility, and love.
