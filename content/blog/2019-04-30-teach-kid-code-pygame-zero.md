**How can you excite a kid about coding and computers?**
As a software developer
and father of two children,
I think about this question often.
A person with software skills
can have big advantages
in our modern world,
so I'd like to equip my kids
for their future.

In my home,
we play video games together.
My children (aged six and four)
watch me play through many classics
like Super Mario World
and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.
They like spending that time with daddy
and are really engaged
with the video game.
When I considered how my six year old son
might enjoy coding,
using video games as the channel
into computing
was a very natural idea.

I've only recently explored game development myself
so making a game
with my son
seemed like a great idea.
When I asked him if he wanted
to make a game,
of course he said *"YES!"*

## To Scratch or Not to Scratch

Once I confirmed his interest,
it was time to figure out what to make.
In the past,
we tried out {{< extlink "https://www.scratchjr.org/" "ScratchJr" >}}.
ScratchJr uses a graphical interface and UI blocks
to compose a set of actions.
The tools that come with ScratchJr
include looping, counting,
and many of the other core things
that belong in software development.
My experience watching my son showed
that ScratchJr was too far removed
from programming.

{{< figure src="/img/2019/scratchjr.png" caption="ScratchJR user interface" >}}

At first,
my son would drag little characters
onto the screen
and make them jump up and down
or move from one side to the other.
Later,
his play transformed
into using the application
as a glorified paint program.
He would record clips
of his voice,
change the colors of the characters,
and mess around with the scene
in countless other ways.
I *love* art
and have absolutely no issue
with him pursuing artistic interests,
but **ScratchJr wasn't teaching programming skills**.
I don't know if the actions were too limited,
or if he didn't see the tool
as a way to make interactive things.

When I considered our game project,
the ScratchJr experience
made me rule out {{< extlink "https://scratch.mit.edu/" "Scratch" >}},
the more advanced version
of building block programming.
I also listened to an excellent episode
of {{< extlink "https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/184/teaching-python-with-bbc-micro-bit" "Talk Python To Me" >}}
that helped re-enforce my belief
that Scratch was not the path to take.
In the episode,
Michael interviewed {{< extlink "https://x.com/ntoll" "Nicolas Tollervey" >}}
about Teaching Python with the BBC micro:bit.

Nicholas made an awesome point
that stuck with me.
As a trained musician,
he noted that musical instruction
teaches kids on real instruments
(albeit smaller to fit the size of children).
Kids develop musical skills
with real instruments,
and these skills are *directly transferible*
when a kid gets a larger version
of the instrument as they grow.
We know this system works
because it's how kids have learned instruments
for hundreds of years.
His point was this:
*if musical instruction demonstrates how to teach a kid a complex skill
like playing an instrument,
why shouldn't we bring this strategy
to teaching programming?*

At that moment,
I became convinced
that the best service
I could offer my son
was to teach him
with a programming language
with all the features he would need.
Naturally,
as a long time Pythonista
and {{< extlink "https://www.pythonfrederick.org/" "user group" >}} organizer,
Python was my obvious choice.

## A Kid Running Python

I still had a lot of aspects
of this project
to figure out.
What is the right user interface
for a kid *who doesn't know how to touch type yet?*
Readers of my content may know
that I'm a big [Vim fan]({{< ref "/blog/2017-11-22-supercharging-vim-using-plugins.md" >}}),
but I certainly wouldn't subject my son to that (yet! ðŸ˜‰ ).

Thankfully,
there was more gold
in that Talk Python To Me episode.
Nicholas is also largely responsible
for the {{< extlink "https://codewith.mu/" "Mu editor" >}}.

{{< figure src="/img/2019/mu.png" caption="Mu user interface" >}}

Mu is an editor focused
on running Python
for beginners.
Mu is **awesome**
for beginners.
Here are some highlights:

* Python is included so there is no need to install something extra!
    This point probably cannot be overstated,
    because Python has a {{< extlink "https://xkcd.com/1987/" "reputation for being complicated to install" >}}.
* A number of popular packages like `requests`, `matplotlib`, and `pyserial`
    come preinstalled
    to lower the barrier further.
* There is a mode to work directly
    with Adafruit's {{< extlink "https://www.adafruit.com/circuitpython" "CircuitPython" >}}
    to use hardware and microcontrollers in Python.
* Game development is possible
    with the preinstalled {{< extlink "https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" "Pygame Zero" >}}.

That final highlight is the clear reason
why I chose to use Mu for my son.

## Pygame Zero Versus Pygame

Pygame Zero is a tool for making video games.
It is separate, but related to {{< extlink "https://www.pygame.org/news" "Pygame" >}},
a long-lived Python project
that let's you build (mostly 2-D) games
using Python.

The differences between Pygame Zero and Pygame are related to the target audience.
I think the {{< extlink "https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" "Pygame Zero documentation" >}}
states their project goal well:

> [Pygame Zero] is intended for use in education, so that teachers can teach basic programming without needing to explain the Pygame API or write an event loop.

I mentioned at the start
of this article
that *I* was learning how to write games too.
In my personal exploration
of game development,
Pygame was my primary choice
for writing games.
(Truthfully,
I started with {{< extlink "https://love2d.org/" "LÃ–VE" >}}
to experiment with {{< extlink "https://www.lua.org/" "Lua" >}}
and made a {{< extlink "https://github.com/mblayman/pong" "Pong clone" >}},
but I concluded Lua wasn't for me.)

The short version
of my experience with Pygame
is that it's not very beginner friendly.
I've learned quite a bit about game development
since I started a couple of years ago.
When I view Pygame today,
it seems more like a game library
than a game engine.
All the pieces are in place
to make a game,
but you have to wire everything together yourself.
Long time game developers may love this flexibility,
but it's fairly overwhelming
to new developers.
And it would border on impossible
for a six year old kid.

When I tried out Pygame Zero,
I was surprised how different the experience was.
Pygame Zero is much more like a game engine.
The common pieces that you must handle yourself
in Pygame
are pre-wired in Pygame Zero.
This dramatically lowers the barrier to entry,
at the cost of flexibility.
**It's absolutely the right trade-off for teaching.**

## What Did We Make?

After all that research,
we made our first game in Pygame Zero.
Let's look at my son's code,
then explore the things *he* learned
as well as the things *I* learned
in the process.

First,
here's his entire first game.

```python
slimearm = Actor('alien')
slimearm.topright = 0, 10

WIDTH = 712
HEIGHT = 508

def draw():
    screen.fill((240, 6, 253))
    slimearm.draw()

def update():
    slimearm.left += 2
    if slimearm.left > WIDTH:
        slimearm.right = 0

def on_mouse_down(pos):
    if slimearm.collidepoint(pos):
        set_alien_hurt()
    else:
        print("you missed me!")

def set_alien_hurt():
    print("Eek!")
    sounds.eep.play()
    slimearm.image = 'alien_hurt'
    clock.schedule_unique(set_alien_normal, 1.0)

def set_alien_normal():
    slimearm.image = 'alien'
```

And here's a screenshot from the game running:

{{< figure src="/img/2019/slimearm.png" caption="First game!" >}}

His entire game fits into 29 lines of code, including blank lines.
In this 29 lines of code,
he was able to learn an enormous amount of stuff.
Also,
to give credit where it is due,
the game is a modified version
of the one listed in the Pygame Zero introduction.
If your eyes are hurting,
you can thank my son
for the hot pink color choice.
The documentation used black,
which might be a better fit for outer space.

## What Did *He* Learn?

If you've been writing code
for a long time,
it's super easy to forget the things
that are hard or weird
in programming.

> Seeing a new programmer wrestle
with core concepts
is a great reminder
that programming is hard,
and we must be vigilant
in our empathy
to those who haven't walked the path we walked.

### Naming Things

In the very first line
of the game,
my son had to deal
with variables.

```python
slimearm = Actor('alien')
```

Variables (especially for someone who hasn't done Algebra)
are a pretty weird concept.
I explained how variables are names for something else
and how the name could be whatever we wanted.
Because our program took many weekends to complete,
we revisited the variables concept each time.
Ultimately,
I found that the best way to show
how little the names mattered
was to suggest we change the name `alien`
in the documentation
to something else.
Thus, `slimearm`, his choice, was born.

Using a different variable name helped give him ownership
of the code he wrote.
We had conversations about how he would have to use his `slimearm` name
instead of what he was seeing
from the documentation page.

### Mutability

My son also learned how malleable software can be.
Pygame Zero made this extremely easy to show.

```python
WIDTH = 712
HEIGHT = 508
```

Setting the window size for the game
requires nothing more than changing `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT`.
My son would:

* Fiddle with the numbers.
* Start the game to see the result, then stop it again.
* Pick some crazy values.
* Start the game to see a wacky window size.
* Repeat until he was happy.

Now that I think about it,
kids would make for amazing Quality Assurance engineers
given their pension to explore and try things out.

### Functions and Side Effects

I think what makes video games so magical
as programs for teaching
is the effects they produce.

Our industry has an odd obsession
with thinking about side effects.
Entire modes of programming try extremely hard
to minimize side effects.
What's odd to me is that side effects
like I/O or drawing to a screen
are often the parts that we actually care about
and want to see!

Games are really neat
because they embrace side effects fully.
Since the side effects show us
that our code is doing things,
they bring a lot of satisfaction.

When I got to the `draw` function,
my son got what he came to see:
the computer doing something that he wrote!
These were the side effects in action.

```python
def draw():
    screen.fill((240, 6, 253))
    slimearm.draw()
```

This `draw` function has no `return` statement.
Each time you call it, the results will be different
because of the state of `slimearm`.
In other words,
it fails to be a "purely functional" function
since it has side effects.
Maybe this makes higher education academics cringe,
but it's *great* for kids.

When we first started `draw`,
we dealt with `screen.fill` as the first side effect.
In my home,
we've played with Arduino circuits regularly
so my children know what LEDs are,
and my son understands that an LED has red, green, and blue lights in it.
I didn't bother explaining tuples,
but I told him that the three numbers
to `fill` were RGB.
We fired up Chrome DevTools,
launched a color picker,
and he dragged around until we found the "perfect" color.

{{< figure src="/img/2019/colorpicker.png" caption="Hoooooot pink!" >}}

### State and Time

Before we could see the effects of `slimearm.draw`
in the `draw` function,
we needed to update the state of the alien
to advance its position.

```python
def update():
    slimearm.left += 2
    if slimearm.left > WIDTH:
        slimearm.right = 0
```

When I reached this stage,
I had to find a method to explain
how Pygame Zero alternates
between `draw` and `update`
to make the game run.
It's an example of the {{< extlink "http://www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com/update-method.html" "Update Method Pattern" >}}. [^1]

[^1]: {{< extlink "http://www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com/" "Game Programming Patterns" >}}
    is a fabulous book.
    It is available to read for free online,
    and I loved it so much
    that I bought it on Amazon
    to support the author, {{< extlink "https://x.com/munificentbob" "Bob Nystrom" >}}.

I used the idea of a filmstrip
to illustrate the concept.
In hindsight,
this probably wasn't the best metaphor
since my son was born in 2012.
We are well into the digital age
for most video production
so film is a rarity.

{{< figure src="/img/2019/filmstrip.png" caption="The game loop as a filmstrip" >}}

After I explained how film worked,
my son latched onto the idea of frames
as individual images that are drawn
on the screen.
We talked about how `update` is in between the frames
and causing the frames to be different
from each other.
He seemed to understand the idea,
but then we had to explore coordinates
and `(x, y)` pairs
and more concepts
from Algebra
that he has not studied yet!

So, I went back to the drawing board, literally.
The best way I could think to explain
how things worked in a 2D coordinate space
was with a paper prototype.

{{< figure src="/img/2019/game-window.png" caption="Our paper prototype" >}}

Our paper prototype was an extremely useful visual tool.
With the prototype,
I made a game window
and our alien character
which I labeled as `slimearm`
to match the variable name.
Using the two separate pieces of paper,
my son could see,
in a very visual way,
how the character would move.
By anchoring on the filmstrip concept,
we iterated through the game loop each frame.
Since he could point to the various parts,
like the `left` edge which advanced
in the `update` method,
he was able to understand
how the computer changed the position
of the alien.

The labels also helped him get a grasp
on the conditional logic.
By asking in each loop
"Is slimearm's left edge farther over than the window width?,"
it became clear when the alien should be positioned back
on the left side
and with what edge
of the sprite.

### Interacting with the Game

Games aren't really games
until you can do something in them.
The point of this game is to try and click the alien.
If you click it,
you'll hear a little sound,
and see the alien temporarily change into a hurt image.

```python
def on_mouse_down(pos):
    if slimearm.collidepoint(pos):
        set_alien_hurt()
    else:
        print("you missed me!")
```

We started with the concept
of events.
Being a digital native,
my son had no trouble
with thinking about actions
like touching a screen.
It took a bit of explanation
to understand a "mouse down" event,
but we used the trusty `print` function
to illustrate the idea quickly.

Mu's game mode has a built-in console
that you can see in the editor
while the game is running.
Our first version of the function above looked more like this:

```python
def on_mouse_down(pos):
    print('You clicked!')
```

Even this simple level of interaction
was enough to make my son light up.
I'd try to talk to him about something,
but he would start up the game
and click around to see an endless stream
of "You clicked!" messages show up in the console.
It turns out that **low tech feedback
is enough to get kids really excited!**

When we moved up to the full function,
I had to explain collisions.
Thankfully,
the paper prototype made this easy
because we could make a game out of the game.
I told my son to pretend to play the game
while I was the computer.
I'd slide the alien cutout along
and yell out "**Eek!**" or "**You missed me!**"
as he would try to tap
on it.
Not only did this make us both smile,
but the idea of colliding was really natural
because of the real world analogue.

```python
def set_alien_hurt():
    print("Eek!")
    sounds.eep.play()
    slimearm.image = 'alien_hurt'
    clock.schedule_unique(set_alien_normal, 1.0)
```

When we got to the `set_alien_hurt` function,
we were really dealing
with the {{< extlink "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg" "juice" >}}
of the game
by adding sound effects and changing sprite images.
The trickiest part of this was to explain computer clocks
and the purpose of the line:

```python
    clock.schedule_unique(set_alien_normal, 1.0)
```

I'm still not sure if he latched onto this concept or not.
Frankly,
we had nearly everything working
so his interest in adding more code waned rapidly.
`schedule_unique` is a challenging bit of code.
You need to understand that functions are things
that can be passed around like variables.
You also need to wrestle with the idea
that `set_alien_normal` will be called some time
in the future
and not by code that you wrote.
I didn't belabor this point
in the code
because we definitely reached the limits
of his curiosity.

That brings us to the end of his game code.
My son covered:

* Naming
* Mutability
* Functions and side effects
* State and time, and
* Interaction

That's a pretty amazing list of topics
for almost any programmer!

## What Did *I* Learn?

Let's close this out
with some of my personal lessons
as a teacher.
Some of the lessons were reminders
of things I knew,
but some of these were new lessons.
I'm a parent
of a kid
who is just starting to come into his own
and take ownership
of his learning,
so I'm learning how to help him best.

### Repetition, Repetition, Repetition

And one more time: *repetition*.
For most of us,
our brains don't lock-on
to concepts
after the first exposure.
We need to experience things repeatedly
for the concepts to sink in.
I saw this as my son grappled
with variables.
Each week as he recalled variables,
I had to remind him
of what they were for.

If I wasn't prepared
for this kind
of behavior,
it would be effortless
to get irritated.
Since I've dealt
with variables
for years,
I am so far removed
from that first exposure
that I barely recall what it was like.
Exercising patience was my solution
when it felt like he wasn't mastering concepts.

### Feedback Is Critical

I observed
that my son was most interested
when the computer would do something
based on his input.
Whether it was showing colors,
displaying text,
making sounds,
or whatever else,
he would delight
in those moments of feedback.
This is what brought me satisfaction as well.
Seeing the joy
on your child's face
as they latch onto an idea
is one of those rewards
of being a parent. [^2]

[^2]: Being a parent is certainly not all sunshine and roses.
    I have plenty of respect for people
    who have no desire to be parents.
    Also, I'm sure it's possible to experience this same kind
    of satisfaction
    for kids who are not your children.
    I'd guess that this satisfaction
    is a big motivator for teachers.

### Use Props

Kids learn in multiple ways.
When I hit a wall explaining some ideas
with words,
switching to a paper prototype
dramatically improved the education experience
for both of us.
Not only was it a quick craft we could do together,
but it was a fabulous aide
in this process.

### Recognize the Limits

Do I think my son would be able to make a game
on his own now?
Certainly not.
I had to remember that there are limits
to how much he would retain
as we made this game.
I didn't expect him to become an amazing programmer
after we finished.
This meant that when we ran into some
of the harder concepts,
I would push a little to make him stretch his thinking,
but back off when it was clear he wasn't ready
for an idea yet.

### Celebrate!

Anyone who knows me well
will know that I can be fairly stoic.
*This was not the time to be stoic.*
Making a game comes
with a certain amount
of intrinsic reward,
but I also wanted my son
to see a very clear extrinsic reward.
Learning to program *is* difficult
and making something that works
(even if it comes from a documentation tutorial)
is a feat worth celebrating for sure.

How many kids manage to make
their own functioning video game?
I'm sure that number is small
in the scheme of things.
So, I tried my best to get out of my normally stoic shell
and celebrate with my son.
In doing that,
he could appreciate what he accomplished
with someone who understood the project
and cares for him.

## Now What?

It didn't take long
before he started to have ideas
of his own
about the next game
that we can make together.
That game is still
in the planning and ideation phases,
but he's excited to work on one.

That's exactly the outcome I was hoping for.
My son now sees programming as a tool
for making things.
And,
I think the world could use more makers.
