For Python Frederick's September presentation,
I presented on Python testing.
In the presentation,
I explained more
of the features
of pytest
that went beyond the basics
that we explored in March.

In this presentation,
I focused on a few big areas:

* Creating tests with a wide variety of example data
    using `@pytest.mark.parametrize`.
* Advice on organizing your test suite
    as the suite grows.
* Exploring fixtures as a tool for setup and reuse.
* Examining some useful built-in fixtures.
