is a great community
for developer content.
If you have articles
that you don't want live all at once,
how can you publish
on a schedule automatically?
In this article,
let's use GitHub Actions
to get your content online
on your timeline.

GitHub Actions is a way to run code
on GitHub's servers.
The service is effectively a Continuous Integration (CI) service
from GitHub.
To use GitHub Actions,
we create a *workflow*
in a Git repository.
That workflow contains all the steps
to run the code we care about.

To publish to DEV,
we can:

1. Use a workflow...
2. To read a publishing schedule we create...
3. And check the current time...
4. And publish an article to DEV
    if the publish date is in the past.

Before we get to the workflow,
let's look at the code that will run.

## Creating a schedule

The first step
in this whole process
is to create a publishing schedule
that our script can read.
Minimally,
that requires two types of data
from a list
of articles:

1. The ID of the article
2. The datetime to publish at

So, where do we get those things?

The first datum comes
from your actual unpublished articles.
From my observation,
the DEV website does not expose this ID
in an obvious fashion
from the UI,
but it's not hard to find.

From your unpublished article page,
view the source
of the page.
In both Firefox
and Chrome,
you can get to this
by selecting "View Page Source"
when you right click somewhere
on the page.

{{< figure src="/img/2019/page-source.png" caption="View Page Source on Firefox" >}}

On the source page,
search for `article-id`
with `Ctrl+F`
(or `Cmd+F` on macOS).
You should find a number value
like `168727`.

Now we have what we need
to build a schedule.
We'll use the JSON format
for the schedule
because Python can read that format easily.
You can name the file whatever you want,
but I called mine `devto-schedule.json`
and stored it
at the root
of my repository.

We also need a datetime
when we want to publish the article.
I used the ISO-8601 standard
to make dates that we can compare
to the current time.
To continue our example,
if I want to publish the article
on October 22, 2019
at 2pm Eastern Time
in the US,
then the schedule looks like:

```json
[{
    "id": 168727,
    "publish_date": "2019-10-22T18:00:00+00:00",
    "title": "Ep 11"
},
{
    "id": 167526,
    "publish_date": "2019-10-15T18:00:00+00:00",
    "title": "Ep 10"
}]
```

We've got the ID as `id`
and the datetime as `publish_date`.
The `publish_date` uses UTC
to store the time.
Timezones are hard
so I would always recommend storing your datetimes
in UTC.

I also included a `title`
so I know what article the object refers to
in the future.
`title` isn't necessary,
but it's useful
for tracking the articles.

Notice that this is a JSON list.
I included an extra article
so you can see what this would look like
if the script checks multiple articles
(which is kind of the point).

## Publishing to DEV

With the schedule
in hand,
we're ready to look at the code
that will do all the work.
I'll start by showing the whole script,
and we'll break it down
into each section.

First, the main file, `publish.py`:

```python
"""Publish scheduled articles to DEV."""
import datetime
import json
import logging
import sys

from dateutil.parser import parse

from devto import DEVGateway

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def publish_scheduled_articles():
    dev_gateway = DEVGateway()
    published_articles = dev_gateway.get_published_articles()
    published_article_ids = set([article["id"]
                                for article in published_articles])

    scheduled_articles = get_scheduled_articles()
    for scheduled_article in scheduled_articles:
        if should_publish(scheduled_article, published_article_ids):
            article_id = scheduled_article["id"]
            logger.info(f"Publishing article with id: {article_id}")
            dev_gateway.publish(article_id)


def get_scheduled_articles():
    """Get the schedule."""
    logger.info("Read schedule.")
    with open("devto-schedule.json", "r") as f:
        return json.load(f)


def should_publish(article, published_article_ids):
    """Check if the article should be published.

    This depends on if the date is in the past
    and if the article is already published.
    """
    publish_date = parse(article["publish_date"])
    now = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)
    return publish_date < now and article["id"] not in published_article_ids


if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging.basicConfig(
        format="%(levelname)s: %(message)s",
        level=logging.INFO, stream=sys.stdout
    )
    publish_scheduled_articles()
```

And then the supporting DEV file, `devto.py`:

```python
import os

import requests


class DEVGateway:
    url = "https://dev.to/api"

    def __init__(self):
        self.session = requests.Session()
        self.session.headers = {"api-key": os.environ["DEV_API_KEY"]}

    def get_published_articles(self):
        """Get all the published articles."""
        response = self.session.get(
            f"{self.url}/articles/me/published", params={"per_page": 1000}
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()

    def publish(self, article_id):
        """Publish the article."""
        data = {"article": {"published": True}}
        response = self.session.put(f"{self.url}/articles/{article_id}",
                                    json=data)
        response.raise_for_status()
```

### The top down view

Let's start our examination
with the entry point
at the bottom of the `publish.py` file.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging.basicConfig(
        format="%(levelname)s: %(message)s",
        level=logging.INFO, stream=sys.stdout
    )
    publish_scheduled_articles()
```

This code follows Python's popular pattern
of checking the `__name__` attribute
to see if it is `__main__`.
This will be true
when the code runs
with `python3 publish.py`.

Since the script is going to run
in Continuous Integration,
we configure the logging
to output to stdout.
Running on stdout is necessary
because we don't have easy access
to files generated from GitHub Actions,
including log files.

The next call is to `publish_scheduled_articles`.
I could have called this `main`,
but I chose to give it a descriptive name.
We'll continue working top down
to see what `publish_scheduled_articles` does.

```python
def publish_scheduled_articles():
    dev_gateway = DEVGateway()
    published_articles = dev_gateway.get_published_articles()
    published_article_ids = set([article["id"]
                                for article in published_articles])

    scheduled_articles = get_scheduled_articles()
    for scheduled_article in scheduled_articles:
        if should_publish(scheduled_article, published_article_ids):
            article_id = scheduled_article["id"]
            logger.info(f"Publishing article with id: {article_id}")
            dev_gateway.publish(article_id)
```

The overall flow of this function can be described as:

1. Get what is already published to DEV.
2. Get what is scheduled for publishing.
3. Publish a scheduled article if it should be published.

To see what is published on DEV,
we need to dig into the next layer
and see how we communicate
with DEV.

### A gateway to DEV

DEV has a JSON API
that developers can interact with.
To keep a clean abstraction layer,
I used the
{{< extlink "https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/gateway.html" "Gateway Pattern" >}}
to hide the details
of how that API communication happens.
By doing that,
the script interacts
with a high level interface
(like `get_published_articles`)
rather than fiddling
with the `requests` module directly.

```python
class DEVGateway:
    url = "https://dev.to/api"

    def __init__(self):
        self.session = requests.Session()
        self.session.headers = {"api-key": os.environ["DEV_API_KEY"]}

    def get_published_articles(self):
        """Get all the published articles."""
        response = self.session.get(
            f"{self.url}/articles/me/published", params={"per_page": 1000}
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

When we create a gateway instance,
we start a `requests.Session`
that is configured
with the proper API key.
We'll talk about how GitHub gets access
to that API key later,
but you'll need to create a key
on the DEV website.
You can find this under your Settings/Account section.

{{< figure src="/img/2019/dev-settings.png" caption="Generating an API key" >}}

With the key available,
we can ask DEV about our own stuff.
I used the `/articles/me/published` API
to get the list of published articles.
The published articles are required
to check that the script is idempotent
(which means that we can safely run it repeatedly
without suffering from weird side effects).

Since the gateway is small,
let's look at its other method
before moving on.

```python
    def publish(self, article_id):
        """Publish the article."""
        data = {"article": {"published": True}}
        response = self.session.put(f"{self.url}/articles/{article_id}",
                                    json=data)
        response.raise_for_status()
```

When the script confirms
that an article is ready to publish,
we change the state
of the article
by setting the `published` attribute to `True`.
We do this state modification
with an HTTP PUT.

The other bit of code worth discussing is `response.raise_for_status()`.
Truthfully,
I was a bit lazy
when writing this part
of the script.
`raise_for_status` will raise an exception
whenever the response is not a `200 OK`.
I put it in as a safeguard
in case something about the API changes
in the future.
The part that's missing
(and the laziness that I mentioned)
is the handling
of those exceptions.

When a request failure occurs,
this script is going to fail hard
and dump out a traceback.
From my point of view,
**that's fine**.
Since this will be part of a CI job,
the only person seeing the traceback will be me,
and I will want whatever data the traceback reports.
This is one of those scenarios
where a developer tool can have a sharper edge
than production-caliber code
and be perfectly reasonable.

### Checking the schedule

Now we've seen how the gateway works.
We can move our attention
to the schedule.

```python
def get_scheduled_articles():
    """Get the schedule."""
    logger.info("Read schedule.")
    with open("devto-schedule.json", "r") as f:
        return json.load(f)
```

This might be the most vanilla code
in the entire script.
This code reads the JSON file
which has our schedule
of articles.
The file handle is passed to `load`
to create the list
of articles
with a future publication date.

```python
    for scheduled_article in scheduled_articles:
        if should_publish(scheduled_article, published_article_ids):
            article_id = scheduled_article["id"]
            logger.info(f"Publishing article with id: {article_id}")
            dev_gateway.publish(article_id)
```

Here is the heart
of the script.
We:

1. Loop through the schedule.
2. Check if we should publish an article.
3. Publish the article if we should.

Why did I pull the list
of published articles earlier?
Now we get our answer
when examining `should_publish`
which needs the published articles.

```python
def should_publish(article, published_article_ids):
    """Check if the article should be published.

    This depends on if the date is in the past
    and if the article is already published.
    """
    publish_date = parse(article["publish_date"])
    now = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)
    return publish_date < now and article["id"] not in published_article_ids
```

There are actually two factors
to consider
when checking a scheduled article.

* Is the article's publication date
    in the past
    from now?
* Has the script already published the article?

That second question is less obvious
until you see
that this CI job is running regularly.
Because we'll configure the script to run every hour,
we want to ensure
that we don't try to publish an article multiple times.
`should_publish` guards against multiple publishing
by checking if the article's `id` is in the list
of published IDs.

Now you've seen
from top to bottom
how this script can publish articles
to DEV.
Our next step is to hook the script
into GitHub Actions.

## Running on GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions works
by defining workflows
in a `.github/workflows` directory
in your repository.
The workflow file is a YAML file
with the commands
to do the work.

We're calling our workflow
`.github/workflows/devto-publisher.yaml`,
but you can name it whatever you want
as long as the extension ends
with `.yaml` or `.yml`.

As before,
let's look
at the entire workflow file
and break down the pieces
to get an understanding
of what's happening.

```yaml
name: DEV Publisher
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'

jobs:
  publish:
    name: Publish to DEV
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Get the code
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v1
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
          architecture: 'x64'
      - name: Install packages
        run: pip install -r requirements/pub.txt
      - name: Run publisher
        run: python bin/publish.py
        env:
          DEV_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEV_API_KEY }}
```

You can optionally give your workflow a `name`.
I like adding a name because it's friendlier
for me
to read in the logs
over the filename.
If filenames suit you better,
skip it!

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'
```

The `on` section is critical
and defines
when your action will occur.
There are tons
of different events you can use.
For this workflow,
we need the `schedule` trigger.
All the gory details about it
are in the {{< extlink "https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events-schedule" "documentation" >}}.

If you're familiar with cron,
this syntax won't shock you.
Non-cron users might wonder what the heck is going on.
The docs explains all the syntax,
but this particular string
of `0 * * * *`
means "run on the zeroth minute of every hour of every day."
In other words,
"run at the start of every hour."

```yaml
jobs:
  publish:
    name: Publish to DEV
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

All workflows need at least one job.
Without a job,
there is nothing for the action to do.
I've named this job `publish`,
given it a friendly name,
and defined what operating system
to run on
(namely, Ubuntu).

```yaml
    steps:
      - name: Get the code
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v1
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
          architecture: 'x64'
      - name: Install packages
        run: pip install -r requirements/pub.txt
      - name: Run publisher
        run: python bin/publish.py
        env:
          DEV_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEV_API_KEY }}
```

The job runs a series of `steps`.
Again,
I tried to name each step
so that we can get a readable flow
of what is happening.
If I extract the names,
we get:

1. Get the code
2. Set up Python
3. Install packages
4. Run publisher

The first two steps
in the process
pull from pre-built actions
developed by GitHub.
GitHub gives us these actions
to save time
from figuring these things out ourselves.
For instance,
without the `actions/checkout@v1` action,
how would we get a local clone?
It would be really challenging.

The third step starts to use configuration specific
to my job.
In order for the script to run,
it needs dependencies installed
so we can import `requests` and `dateutil`.
I defined a `requirements/pub.txt` file
that includes all the needed dependencies.

Here's what the requirements file looks like:

```text
#
# This file is autogenerated by pip-compile
# To update, run:
#
#    pip-compile requirements/pub.in
#
certifi==2019.9.11        # via requests
chardet==3.0.4            # via requests
idna==2.8                 # via requests
python-dateutil==2.8.0
requests==2.22.0
six==1.12.0               # via python-dateutil
urllib3==1.25.3           # via requests
```

Finally,
we get to the step that runs the publisher.

```yaml
      - name: Run publisher
        run: python bin/publish.py
        env:
          DEV_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEV_API_KEY }}
```

This is pretty vanilla
except for the `DEV_API_KEY` line.
Look back
at the `DEVGateway.__init__` method.
The method pulls from `os.environ`
to get the API key.
In our YAML file,
we're wiring the `DEV_API_KEY` environment variable
to the `secrets.DEV_API_KEY`.
We need to tell GitHub
about our API key.

In your GitHub repository settings,
we can define secrets.
These secrets are available
to workflow files
as we see
from the "Run publisher" step.
Create a secret named `DEV_API_KEY`
that contains your DEV API key.

{{< figure src="/img/2019/github-secrets.png" caption="GitHub secrets" >}}

Now everything is in place
to run the publisher.
This workflow will execute every hour
and run the `publish` job.
That job will setup the environment
and execute the `publish.py` script.
The script will call DEV
and publish any articles
in your schedule
that should be published.

## What did we learn?

In this article,
I tried to show off
a few different topics.

1. How to communicate with the DEV API
2. How to create a file that a computer can read and parse
    (i.e., the JSON schedule)
3. How to use GitHub actions
    to run some code
    for your repository.

Want to see all this code
in context?
The {{< extlink "https://github.com/mblayman/mattlayman.com" "repository" >}}
for this website
has all the files
we covered.

There are so many other things you can do
with GitHub Actions.
Now you can write about them all
and put them
on a schedule
for other developers
to read
when you're ready.
