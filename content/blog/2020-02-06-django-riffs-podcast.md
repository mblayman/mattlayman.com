description: >-
    I started a new podcast called Django Riffs.
    Django Riffs is all about learning
    how to use the Django web framework.
    The show will take beginners
    on a tour of Django
    to help them gain proficiency.

I've started a podcast!
The podcast is called Django Riffs,
and my goal is to help beginners learn
how to use {{< extlink "https://www.djangoproject.com/" "Django" >}}.
You can find the show on
{{< extlink "https://open.spotify.com/show/1RtdveQIz5m5MqLKPWbhnD" "Spotify" >}}
or check Apple Podcasts
or wherever you get podcasts.

Each episode of the podcast will be a topical exploration
of one facet
of the Django web framework.
With many years
of Django under my belt,
I believe I have the experience
to help beginners
on their journey into learning Django.
More experienced Djangonauts may benefit
from a refresher
on the subjects
that we cover.

With this launch announcement,
I am releasing the first two episodes.

* The first episode,
    Get To Know Django,
    gets us situated
    with where Django exists
    in the context
    of the internet
    and web application development.
* In the second episode,
    Enter With URLs,
    we start our exploration
    of Django's features
    by focusing on how Django sets up URLs.

These episodes take quite a while to produce
because of the research, preparation, and production
of each one.
My aim is to get out a new show every couple
of weeks if I can.

If you would like,
you can follow the show
on {{< extlink "https://open.spotify.com/show/1RtdveQIz5m5MqLKPWbhnD" "Spotify" >}}.
Or follow me or the show
on X
at
{{< extlink "https://x.com/mblayman" "@mblayman" >}}
or
{{< extlink "https://x.com/djangoriffs" "@djangoriffs" >}}.

I hope you enjoy this.
Please feel free to reach out to me
with comments or feedback.
My mission is to make a great Django learning experience
for new developers
and grow the Django community.
