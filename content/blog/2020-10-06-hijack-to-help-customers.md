You have an upset customer
with a really thorny problem
on your Django-powered website.
Your customer used your help ticket system
and reported their woe.
You've done your due diligence
and have already checked:

* The logs from your site show nothing interesting related
    to the customer's actions
* The error tracking system reveals no exceptions
    from what the customer did
* The customer's description doesn't contain enough info
    to diagnose the problem fully
* The experiments in your dev environment have not worked
    to replicate the problem

**What can you do?**
Solving difficult software problems often requires the ability
to reproduce the issue.
As the saying goes,
you can learn a lot
by walking a mile
in someone else's shoes.

If you could access
your customer's account
and see what they see,
you might be able
to deduce what went wrong
by seeing the issue for yourself.
Django takes the sensible approach
of *not* storing plain text passwords
in your database
so you can't log in as your customer.
*Or can you?*
With {{< extlink "https://django-hijack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" "django-hijack" >}},
you *can* impersonate a user account
to experience what your customer experiences.

In the remainder of this article,
we'll look at my experience
with integrating django-hijack
to provide this capability
for one of my personal side projects.
By the time we're done,
I think you'll have a good idea
of how to add django-hijack
to your own project
if you need to support your customers
by impersonating their accounts.

## Hello Hijack!

We need to start by installing django-hijack
in your project.

```bash
(venv) $ pip install django-hijack
```

Once you've installed the package
from PyPI,
we must add it to `INSTALLED_APPS`
and include some URLs
which the package uses
for its purposes.
django-hijack relies
on two separate applications,
`hijack`
and a `compat` app
that `hijack` depends on.

```python
# project/settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'hijack',
    'compat',
    ...
]
```

```python
# project/urls.py

urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path("hijack/", include("hijack.urls")),
    ...
]
```

There's one final setting
that I added
for my project,
but we'll see it later.

## Hijacked Templates

When you're impersonating a customer's account,
you want to have very obvious signs
that you're not in your own account.
This should aid you
from doing something stupid
like deleting your customer's data.

django-hijack gives us some tools
for our templates
to help check
if the logged in session is hijacked or not.
With these features,
you can modify your templates
to get your attention
when you're masquerading
as your customer.

On the project
where I included django-hijack,
my theme color is blue.
My default user interface looks like:

{{< figure src="/img/2020/school-desk-ui.png" caption="School Desk standard UI" >}}

I used django-hijack's built-in template tags
to make the default navigation red instead of blue
and added some context
of who I am impersonating
when hijacking a customer's account.
Here's a sample of the output
(note: this is from my development machine
and you're not looking at someone's real data):

{{< figure src="/img/2020/school-desk-hijacked.png" caption="School Desk hijacked UI" >}}

To make this change,
I modified a navigation bar template
in my project.
The template code showing the relevant part is:

```django
{% load hijack_tags %}

{% if request|is_hijacked %}
  <div class="mr-4 font-light">
    As: {{ user.email }}
  </div>
  <form class="mr-4" method="POST" action="{% url 'hijack:release_hijack' %}">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <button class="hover:underline font-light" type="submit">Release</button>
  </form>
{% endif %}
```

First,
we must be certain
that the `hijack_tags` are loaded.
This gives access to an `is_hijacked` template filter.
The filter is designed
to get the `request` object provided
by the `django.template.context_processor.request` context processor.
That context processor has the singular job
of adding the `request` to the context.

```python
# django/template/context_processors.py

...

def request(request):
    return {'request': request}
```

When `is_hijacked` returns `True`,
I modified the user interface
to show the customer's email address
and the form that let's me release the hijacking
to return to my user account.
There's also a bit of template code
that picks a red CSS class
instead of a blue CSS class
based off of `is_hijacked`
that I'm not bothering
to show in the example code.

## Who Hijacks?

If any user could impersonate another user,
this would be a terrible system.
How can someone hijack another customer's account?
By default, django-hijack will only permit user's
with superuser access
to hijack an account.

This configuration can be controlled
by settings,
but this is a very reasonable default
to me.
Limiting the ability to hijack
to a very small subset is a good security stance
when considering the tradeoffs
of an impersonation feature.

To initiate a hijack,
the library provides a couple of URL endpoints
that can be POSTed too,
but I wanted a more accessible way
to start the process.

In my project,
I created an admin action
that gives me,
as the superuser,
the ability to hijack a customer's account.
The code looks like:

```python
# users/admin.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin as AuthUserAdmin
from hijack.helpers import login_user


@admin.register(get_user_model())
class UserAdmin(AuthUserAdmin):
    actions = ["hijack_user"]

    def hijack_user(self, request, queryset):
        """Hijack a user."""
        if len(queryset) == 1:
            user = queryset[0]
            return login_user(request, user)
```

A hijack request can only apply
to a single customer account
so my admin action checks
that only one user was selected.
Then the code uses the `login_user` helper
from django-hijack
which will do the proper authorization checking
and redirect to the customer's account
if the staff user has the right permissions
(i.e., the staff user using the admin is a superuser).

The `hijack:release_hijack` URL
that I used in the template
from the previous section
also needs some configuration
to return a hijacker's account
to an appropriate destination
when finished with the impersonation.
Since I used an admin action as my entry point,
I decided that it should be my exit point as well.
The settings addition uses the `HIJACK_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL` setting.

```python
# project/settings.py

HIJACK_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = "/<admin site prefix>/users/user/"
```

With this setting,
I can return to the same admin page
that I started with.

## Ethical Considerations

*Should you do this on your project?*

"Hijacking," "impersonating," and "masquerading" are potentially scary terms
when we're talking about customer accounts and data.

I firmly believe that technology can be used
for good and bad purposes.
I'm not blind
to the fact
that hijacking a customer's account can be seen
as an invasion of privacy.

In light of that,
I think we,
as software developers,
need to consider the ethical implications
of our actions.

Using a tool like django-hijack is a last resort.
I started this article
by noting a wide variety
of conditions
that I would consider
before instigating a hijacked session.
Let's see them again as a reminder:

* Did you check all the logs?
* Did you check all the error monitoring tools?
* Did you listen to your customer and think through the problem?
* Did you attempt to replicate the problem in a development environment first?

Impersonating a customer
with this tool is intended
**to help the customer**
when other options aren't able
to produce results.
If you've exhausted all
of your other options,
then I feel that acting
on the customer's behalf
can be an acceptable option.

When logging in as a customer,
I still think it's best to respect privacy
as much as I can.
The goal of an impersonation session is to observe
and diagnose a problem,
*then get out*.
Any actions taken should be limited
to the steps reported
by the customer
in an attempt to observe their problem
in a live context.

If you're on a larger team,
there are also additional steps
that you can take
to be accountable
for your actions
(or a teammate's actions)
while accessing a customer account.

django-hijack includes a couple of custom Django signals
that you can use
to monitor hijack usage.
The signals, `hijack_started` and `hijack_ended`,
will report the users IDs
of both the hijacker and the hijacked customer account.
This data could be added to audit logging
of some kind
and monitored for abuse.

In an ideal world,
we wouldn't require such systems
and could trust all team members,
but having accountability built-in
to a system
is a good alternative
for a world
that obviously isn't ideal.

Lastly,
I'll note that some restrictions might be in place
on your app
by your Privacy Policy
or the laws in your country.
I won't pretend to be a lawyer
so make sure you do your due diligence
with your local legal folk.

> As software developers,
we want to help our customers
and make a good product,
and we should strive to act ethically
in those pursuits.

## Summary

This article covered django-hijack,
a powerful tool
for acting on your customer's behalf
when helping them
with a problem.

I showed how I set this up
for one of my projects.
We examined:

* The initial setup
* How to configure the templates to show a hijacked session
* How to extend the Django `User` admin
    to start a hijacked session
* The ethical considerations to ponder
    before using such a powerful tool

I hope you've learned something
and can apply django-hijack
to your project
to help your customers
as best you can.
