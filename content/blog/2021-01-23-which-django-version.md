Django is a big and popular web framework
for Python
to help you build a web app.
Which Django version should you use?

> If you're starting a Django web app,
**use the latest version of Django available**.

Why listen to me?
I'm a software developer
with over 7 years
of professional Django experience.
I work at companies
that use Django successfully
at the core
of their business.

I'll explain why you should use the latest.

## Why?

If you're asking yourself which version to use,
there are a probably a couple of reasons.

1. You've found learning resources online
    that mention different versions
    of Django.
2. The {{< extlink "https://www.djangoproject.com/download/" "Django project download page" >}}
    has an overwhelming amount
    of information
    about different versions.

So, here's the core reason why you should use the latest version:

> Django is a very mature web framework
(first released in 2005)
that is extremely stable.

What does that stability provide for you?

* **Modern versions of Django are released
    at very regular intervals**.
    This interval is not too fast.
    Unlike like some other libraries out there,
    upgrading is not an exhausting treadmill
    of change.
* **New versions of Django have very few barriers
    when updating**.
    This is the benefit you get
    from a mature and stable project.
    Any required changes between versions are extremely well documented
    in each version's release page.

All this means that you get to spend less time focusing
on your web framework tool choice
and more time focusing
on your web app.

Django also has Long Term Support (LTS) versions.
I don't think that the average developer
or company should use them.
If you upgrade from an older LTS to a newer LTS,
there are going to be more changes.
Each Long Term Support version is farther
from the next
than compared to regular version upgrades.

Long Term Support versions are specifically targeted
at companies
that have slow and cumbersome upgrade cycles
where it's difficult
to integrate new versions.

> Django's stong stability guarantees make picking the latest version
of the framework a no brainer
for new web applications.

`pip install Django` and good luck!
