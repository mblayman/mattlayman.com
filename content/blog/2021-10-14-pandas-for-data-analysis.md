Chris Malec gave an overview of pandas, focusing on how to read in some common data types, create filters to specific table cells, apply functions to your data, merge tables together, and create nice plots as well as summary tables from your data. For an application, Chris used some financial data, and briefly discussed his work at FinRA finding manipulative behavior in the US stock market. #Python #DataScience"
