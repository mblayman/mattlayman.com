In this episode, I debugged the static file handling that my homeschool application is using when it generates PDF reports. Note: There was some stream trouble. This segment of the stream had no webcam video and was disconnected. Part 2 shows the successful completion of the PDF integration which you can see at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5CBNNZMdxs.
