What If I Told You... You Don't Need JavaScript.

This talk explores why JavaScript is not good fit for most web apps.

I then show how most web apps can do dynamic things using htmx. htmx is an extension library to make HTML markup better.

I present examples of AJAX fetching and deletion. The presentation includes a dynamic search and how to implement infinite scrolling with a trivial amount of code.

I provide examples using Django, Flask, RubyOnRails, and Laravel. htmx works great with Python, Ruby, PHP, and many other programming languages.
