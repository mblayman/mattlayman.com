title: "Inventory Management / Custom 404 page / Go gqlgen - Building SaaS #154"
description: "In this episode, I did another Exercism problem in Python which focused on working with dictionaries. Once the exercise was complete, we worked on the homeschool app and created a custom 404 page so that Django would render something beyond a plain page. After working on Django, I did something totally different and worked on some Go code and used gqlgen to create a GraphQL service with generated code produced via a GraphQL schema."

In this episode, I did another Exercism problem in Python which focused on working with dictionaries. Once the exercise was complete, we worked on the homeschool app and created a custom 404 page so that Django would render something beyond a plain page. After working on Django, I did something totally different and worked on some Go code and used gqlgen to create a GraphQL service with generated code produced via a GraphQL schema.
