title: "Locomotive Engineer / New Model Field - Building SaaS with Python and Django #156"
description: "In this episode, I did another Exercism problem in Python that focused on Python packing and unpacking of arguments. Once the exercise was complete, I started on a new feature with the homeschool app. We added a new model field in preparation for the changes. After that, I removed django-stubs because it wasn't a good fit for my project."

After that, I removed django-stubs because it wasn't a good fit for my project.
