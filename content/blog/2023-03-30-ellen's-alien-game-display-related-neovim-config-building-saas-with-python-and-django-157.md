title: "Ellen's Alien Game / Display Related / Neovim config - Building SaaS with Python and Django #157"
description: "In this episode, I did another Exercism problem in Python that focused on Python classes. After the exercise, I deployed my model change from last stream and discussed deployment strategy. Then we worked on some of the display pieces for the new feature. Once the feature was added, I discussed performance testing and showed some performance problems that the new feature created that I then fixed. We ended the stream with some Neovim configuration to correct some LSP formatting problems."
