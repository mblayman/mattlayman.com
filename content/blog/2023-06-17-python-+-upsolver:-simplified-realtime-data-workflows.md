title: "Python + Upsolver: Simplified Realtime Data Workflows"
description: "One of the powerful things about Python is its ability to connect disparate tools into one common integrated development experience. In this talk, we’ll explore how to create and run a near real-time pipeline where we consume events from a Kafka topic and transform the data before landing them in the lake, using Upsolver through our Python SDK. In this way, we get exactly-once processing, strong ordering and automatic schema evolution out of the box thanks to the powerful Upsolver engine, but without having to switch to a different UI and building in SQL only."
