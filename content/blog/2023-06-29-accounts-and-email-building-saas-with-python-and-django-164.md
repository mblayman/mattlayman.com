description: "In this episode, I planned to do the work of sending email prompts for the journal to users. Along the path, we realized that the Account model was missing, so I stopped to build that out before we could proceed. By the end of the stream, we had a working background job that would send email and was 100% unit tested."

Along the path, we realized that the Account model was missing, so I stopped to build that out before we could proceed. By the end of the stream, we had a working background job that would send email and was 100% unit tested.
