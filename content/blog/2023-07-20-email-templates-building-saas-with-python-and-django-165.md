description: "In this episode, we added the prompt email that will be the primary way of connecting to users for our email-based journaling service. I spent a fair amount of time thinking about copy writing to craft a compelling email that will resonate with users. Also, I made a bunch of silly mistakes and to keep correcting myself, so this is a good example of programming humility too."
