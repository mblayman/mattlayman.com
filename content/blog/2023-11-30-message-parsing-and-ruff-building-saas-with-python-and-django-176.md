description: "In this episode, we finished off the core portion of the application by parsing entries out of the messages sent back by SendGrid. We set up the Heroku Scheduler to start the daily flow of emails to get the system started. After completing that, I set up the project to use Ruff instead of the collection of tools used previously."

In this episode, we finished off the core portion of the application by parsing entries out of the messages sent back by SendGrid. We set up the Heroku Scheduler to start the daily flow of emails to get the system started. After completing that, I set up the project to use Ruff instead of the collection of tools used previously.
