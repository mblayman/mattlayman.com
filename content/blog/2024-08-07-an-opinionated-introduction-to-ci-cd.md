title: "An Opinionated Introduction to CI/CD"
description: "Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (or Deployment), CI/CD, is a set of practices used by engineering organizations to improve the quality of software they deliver, how fast they deliver that software, and detect issues with that software before they affect end users. Unfortunately, the term can mean a lot of different ideas and approaches. So, in this talk we’re going to try to unravel some of those ideas to give you some ideas on how you too can deliver software better. I’ll also give you some links to some tooling so you can see how it’s done."
