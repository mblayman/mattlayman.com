What books have been most useful in advancing my career?
**These books.**

These are the books that have taught me the most
about how to be a better software developer.

I hope that distilling this down to a short list is useful
for people that like to read and want to put some quality material
under their belts.

1. {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/3L4gYd4" "The Pragmatic Programmer" >}}
    by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt -
    This book is definitely the most influential
    in improving my thinking about software development.
    The Pragmatic Programmer gave me new ways to think about how to build software
    and provided a mental model for building sofware, uh, pragmatically.
1. {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/40x1sw6" "Crafting Interpreters" >}}
    by Robert Nystrom -
    This book improved my knowledge of how programming languages work
    more than any other.
    There is so much depth and content packed into Crafting Interpreters.
    You would learn _a ton_ by reading this book.
1. {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/3UXLZUw" "Working Effectively With Legacy Code" >}}
    by Michael Feathers -
    What is legacy code?
    Feathers describes legacy code as _untested code_.
    From that level,
    this book teaches all sorts of interesting techniques
    for improving code without tests and how to make a system more adaptable.
1. {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/3mYdPne" "Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software" >}}
    by Charles Petzold -
    My undergraduate degree was in Computer Engineering.
    As someone with that degree,
    I can say that if you want to skip four years of education to learn how computer actually work,
    this is a great substitute for that.
1. {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/3L1qFsX" "Release It!: Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software" >}}
    by Michael Nygard -
    Nygard explains how to make robust systems and covers a bunch of ideas
    to help ensure that your complex software systems stay running
    and running well.
1. {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/3oFd1E4" "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" >}}
    by Martin Fowler -
    This book was really helpful early in my career
    as I learned out to navigate all the big pre-existing software systems
    that I was working in.
    The patterns in this book are still useful to understand today.
1. {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/41Az8dI" "Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!" >}}
    by Fred Hebert -
    Erlang was my first attempt to learn about functional programming languages.
    Not only did I learn about how functional languages work with this book,
    but I also learned about powerful techniques for building very fault-tolerant systems.
1. {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/3orxsnV" "The Architecture of Open Source Applications" >}}
    edited by Amy Brown and Greg Wilson -
    This collection of chapters written by many open source authors
    (and the subsequent volume and the companion books like 500 Lines or Less)
    is a great way to learn about interesting solutions to problems
    from all over the software spectrum.
    Seeing these examples expanded my thinking about what is possible.
1. {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/3NersJs" "Practical Vim" >}}
    by Drew Neil -
    As a long time Vim user,
    this book was a great way to advance my Vim skills.
    The book helped me move from an intermediate Vim user
    to an advanced Vim user.
1. {{< extlink "https://amzn.to/41RhphH" "ZeroMQ" >}}
    by Pieter Hintjens -
    While ZeroMQ may not be as popular of a technology
    as it once was,
    Hintjens covers material and concepts that go far beyond the library.
    This was the first time I was exposed to the powerful idea
    of effectively using code generation
    as part of a software project.

There are books that I plan to add to this list,
but I thought it would be better to get some of them listed
before I can complete my list.
