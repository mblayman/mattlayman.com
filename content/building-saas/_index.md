  Building SaaS is a weekly Twitch stream
  that works through the gritty details
  of building a Software as a Service
  using Python, the Django web framework,
  and other packages from the Django ecosystem.
  The stream runs on Thursday at 9pm ET.

On Thursdays
at 9pm Eastern Time,
I develop a Software as a Service (SaaS)
on {{< extlink "https://www.twitch.tv/mblayman" "Twitch" >}}.

> My primary goal is to **teach people about the Django web framework and Python**.

Django is a big web framework
so I share my experience
from using the project
for 6+ years.

This page contains show notes
and links to each stream.
Join me live if you're interested!

As of February 2021,
I'm no longer writing show notes
for the stream
(sorry, I don't have enough time!).
*I'm still streaming!*

You can find the stream recordings
on my {{< extlink "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFcKEo4b_n1wQA6lKtSqCq1dTMq1c2Lmw" "How To Build SaaS with Python and Django playlist" >}}.
