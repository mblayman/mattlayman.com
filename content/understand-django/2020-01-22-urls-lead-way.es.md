En el 칰ltimo art칤culo de la serie
[Comprendiendo Django]({{< ref "/understand-django/_index.es.md" >}}),
vimos c칩mo la solicitud del navegador de un usuario pasa de su navegador a la "puerta principal" de Django. Ahora es el momento de ver c칩mo Django procesa esas solicitudes.

Una solicitud HTTP proveniente de un navegador incluye una URL que describe qu칠 recurso debe producir Django. Dado que las URL pueden tener muchas formas, debemos instruir a Django sobre los tipos de URL que nuestra aplicaci칩n web puede manejar. Para eso est치 la *configuraci칩n de URL*. En la documentaci칩n de Django, la configuraci칩n de URL se llama URLconf, para abreviar.

쮻칩nde est치 la URLconf? La URLconf est치 en la ruta del m칩dulo establecida por la configuraci칩n `ROOT_URLCONF` en el archivo de configuraci칩n de su proyecto. Si ejecut칩 el comando `startproject`, esa configuraci칩n se llamar치 como `proyecto.urls`, donde "proyecto" es el nombre dado como argumento para el comando. En otras palabras, la URLconf se coloca en `proyecto/urls.py`, justo al lado del archivo `settings.py`.

Eso explica d칩nde reside el archivo, pero no nos dice mucho sobre c칩mo funciona. Profundicemos m치s.

{{< understand-django-series-es "urls" >}}

## URLconf en acci칩n

Trata de pensar en la configuraci칩n de URL como una lista de rutas de URL que Django intentar치 hacer coincidir de arriba a abajo. Cuando Django encuentra una ruta coincidente, la solicitud HTTP se enruta a un fragmento de c칩digo de Python asociado con esa ruta. Ese "trozo de c칩digo de Python" se llama una *vista* que explicaremos m치s en un momento. Por el momento, conf칤a en que las vistas saben c칩mo manejar las solicitudes HTTP.

Podemos usar un URLconf de ejemplo para darle vida a este concepto:

```python
# project/urls.py
from django.urls import path

from application import views

urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.home),
    path("about/", views.about),
    path("contact/", views.contact),
    path("terms/", views.terms),
]
```

Lo que vemos aqu칤 coincide bien con lo que describ칤 anteriormente: una lista de rutas de URL que Django intentar치 hacer coincidir de arriba a abajo. El aspecto clave de esta lista es el nombre de `urlpatterns`. Django tratar치 la lista en una variable `urlpatterns` como URLconf.

El orden de esta lista tambi칠n es importante porque Django dejar치 de escanear la lista tan pronto como encuentre una coincidencia. El ejemplo no muestra ning칰n conflicto entre las rutas, pero es posible crear dos entradas de ruta (`path`) diferentes que pueden coincidir con la misma URL que env칤a un usuario. Mostrar칠 un ejemplo de c칩mo puede suceder eso despu칠s de que veamos otro aspecto de las rutas.

Podemos trabajar con un ejemplo para ver c칩mo funciona esto para `www.example.com`. Al considerar una URL en una URLconf, Django ignora el esquema (`https://`), el dominio (`www.example.com`) y la barra inclinada inicial para la coincidencia. Todo lo dem치s es con lo que se comparar치 la URLconf.

* Una solicitud a `https://www.example.com/about/` se ver치 como `"about/"` para el proceso de coincidencia de patrones y coincidir치 con la segunda ruta. Esa solicitud se enruta a la vista `views.about`.
* Una solicitud a `https://www.example.com/` se ver치 como `""` (una cadena de texto vac칤a) en el proceso de coincidencia de patrones y coincidir치 con la primera ruta. Esa solicitud se enruta a la vista `views.home`.

> Aparte: puedes notar que las URL de Django terminan con un car치cter de barra inclinada. Este comportamiento se debe a una elecci칩n de
{{< extlink "https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/misc/design-philosophies/#definitive-urls" "filosof칤a de dise침o" >}} choice.
de Django. De hecho, si intenta llegar a una URL como `https://www.example.com/about`, Django redirigir치 la solicitud a la misma URL con la barra inclinada a침adida debido a la
{{< extlink "https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/settings/#append-slash" "configuraci칩n predeterminada" >}}
de `APPEND_SLASH`.

## The `path` Before Us

The string part of `path`
(e.g., `"about/"`) is called the *route*.
A route can be a plain string
as you've seen,
but it can include other special structures
with a feature called *converters*.
When you use a converter,
you can extract information out
of a URL
that a view can use later.
Consider a path like this:

```python
    path(
        "blog/<int:year>/<slug:slug>/",
        views.blog_post
    ),
```

The two converters in this path are:

* `<int:year>`
* `<slug:slug>`

The use of angle brackets
and some {{< extlink "https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/http/urls/#path-converters" "reserved names" >}}
cause Django to perform extra parsing
on a URL.
Each converter has some expected rules to follow.

* The `int` converter must match an integer.
* The `slug` converter must match a slug.
    Slug is a bit of newspaper lingo
    that appears in Django
    because Django started
    as a project
    out of a newspaper in Kansas.
    A slug is a string that can include characters, numbers, dashes, and underscores.

Given those converter definitions,
let's compare against some URLs!

* `https://www.example.com/blog/2020/urls-lead-way/` - MATCH!
* `https://www.example.com/blog/twenty-twenty/urls-lead-way/` - NOPE.
* `https://www.example.com/blog/0/life-in-rome/` - MATCH!
    Uh, maybe not what we wanted though.
    Let's look at that soon.

Now we can revisit our ordering problem
from earlier.
Consider these two paths
in different orders:

```python
    path(
        "blog/<int:year>/",
        views.blog_by_year
    ),
    path(
        "blog/2020/",
        views.blog_for_twenty_twenty
    ),

# vs.

    path(
        "blog/2020/",
        views.blog_for_twenty_twenty
    ),
    path(
        "blog/<int:year>/",
        views.blog_by_year
    ),
```

In the first ordering,
the converter will match any integer following `blog/`,
including `https://www.example.com/blog/2020/`.
That means that the first ordering will never call the `blog_for_twenty_twenty` view
because Django matches `path` entries in order.

Conversely,
in the second ordering,
`blog/2020/` will route to `blog_for_twenty_twenty` properly
because it is matched first.
That means there's a lesson
to remember here:

{{< web >}}
> When including `path` entries that match
    on ranges of values
    with converters (like the years example above),
    be sure to put them **after** the more specific entries.
{{< /web >}}

When including `path` entries that match
    on ranges of values
    with converters (like the years example above),
    be sure to put them **after** the more specific entries.
{{< /book >}}

## An Abbreviated View Of Views

What do converters do with this extra data?
That's hard to explain
without touching on views.
{{< web >}}
The next article will cover views
{{< /web >}}
{{< book >}}
The next chapter will cover views
{{< /book >}}
in far more depth,
but here's a primer.

A view is code
that takes a request
and returns a response.
Using Python's optional type hinting,
here's an example
that will send a `Hello World` response.

```python
from django.http import (
    HttpRequest,
    HttpResponse
)

def some_view(
    request: HttpRequest
) -> HttpResponse:
    return HttpResponse('Hello World')
```

The `HttpRequest` is Django's translated format
of an HTTP request
wrapped up in a convenient container class.
Likewise, `HttpResponse` is what we can use
so that Django will translate our response data
into a properly formatted HTTP response
that will be sent back to the user's browser.

Now we can look
at one of the converters again.

```python
    path(
        "blog/<int:year>/",
        views.blog_by_year
    ),
```

With this converter in place
in the route,
what would `blog_by_year` look like?

```python
# application/views.py
from django.http import HttpResponse

def blog_by_year(request, year):
    # ... some code to handle the year
    data = 'Some data set by code above'
    return HttpResponse(data)
```

Django begins to reveal some nice qualities here!
The converter did a bunch
of tedious work
for us.
The `year` argument set
by Django
will already be an integer
because Django did the string parsing
and conversion.

If someone submits `/blog/not_a_number/`,
Django will return a Not Found response
because `not_a_number` can't be an integer.
The benefit of this
is that we don't have to put extra checking logic
in `blog_by_year`
to handle the weird case where `year` doesn't look like a number.
That kind of feature is a real time saver!
It keeps your code cleaner
*and* makes handling more precise.

What about that other strange example
that we saw earlier
of `/blog/0/life-in-rome/`?
That would match our pattern
from the earlier section,
but let's assume we want to match a four digit year.
How can we do that?
We can use regular expressions.

## Regular Expression Paths

Regular expressions are a programming feature
often likened to a chainsaw:
*they are incredibly powerful,
but you can cut off your foot
if you're not careful.*

Regular expressions can express complex patterns
of characters
in a concise way.
This conciseness often gives regular expressions a bad reputation
of being difficult to understand.
When used carefully, though,
they can be highly effective.

A regular expression
(which is often abbreviated to "regex")
matches complex patterns
in strings.
This sounds exactly like our blog year problem!
In our problem,
we want to match a four digit integer only.
Let's look at a solution
that Django can handle
and then break down what it means.

As a reminder,
this solution will match some URL path
like `blog/2020/urls-lead-way/`.

Note, we use the `re_path()` function for 
regular expression matching here, instead of `path()`.

```python
re_path(
    r"^blog/(?P<year>[0-9]{4})/(?P<slug>[\w-]+)/$",
    views.blog_post
),
```

This crazy string behaves exactly like our earlier example
**except** that it is more precise
about only allowing four digit years.
The crazy string also has a name.
It is called a *regex pattern*.
When the Django code runs,
it will test URL paths against the rules
that are defined in this pattern.

To see how it works,
we have to know what the parts of the pattern mean.
We can explain this pattern one chunk
at a time.

* The string itself starts with `r"`
    because it is a raw string in Python.
    This is used because regular expressions use `\` extensively.
    Without a raw string,
    a developer would have to escape the backslash repeatedly
    by using `\\`.
* The caret, `^`, means "the pattern must *start* here."
    Because of the caret,
    a path that starts like `myblog/...` will not work.
* `blog/` is a literal interpretation.
    Those characters must match exactly.
* The portion inside parentheses `(?P<year>[0-9]{4})` is a *capture group*.
    The `?P<year>` is the name to associate
    with the capture group and is similar
    to the right side of the colon
    in a converter like `<int:year>`.
    The name allows Django
    to pass on the content
    in an argument called `year`
    to the view.
    The other part of the capture group, `[0-9]{4}`,
    is what the pattern is actually matching.
    `[0-9]` is a *character class*
    which means "match any number from 0 through 9."
    The `{4}` means that it must match **exactly** four times.
    This is the specificity that `re_path` gives
    that the `int` converter could not!
* The slash, `/`, between capture groups is another literal character to match.
* The second capture group, `(?P<slug>[\w-]+)`, will put whatever it matches
    into an argument named `slug`.
    The character class of `[\w-]` contains two types
    of characters. `\w` means any word character
    that you might have in a natural language
    and digits and underscores.
    The other type of character is a literal dash, `-`, character.
    Finally, the plus, `+`, character means
    that the character class must match 1 or more times.
* The last slash is also a literal character match.
* To complete the pattern,
    the dollar sign, `$`, acts like the opposite
    of the caret and means
    "the pattern must *end* here."
    Thus, `blog/2020/some-slug/another-slug/` will not match.

Note that you cannot mix the `path` style and `re_path` style strings.
The example above had to describe the slug as a regular expression
instead of using the slug converter (i.e., `<slug:slug>`).

Congratulations!
This is definitely the hardest section
{{< web >}}
of this article.

If you understood what we did
with `re_path`,
the rest of this should feel very comfortable.
If not,
*please don't fret about it!*
If you want to know more about regular expressions,
know that everything I described
in the pattern
is *not* Django specific.
Instead,
this is Python's built-in behavior.
You can learn more
about regular expressions
from Python's {{< extlink "https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html" "Regular Expression HOWTO" >}}.

Knowing that this power
with `re_path`
is there may help you later
on your Django journey,
even if you don't need it now.

## Grouping Related URLs

Up to this point,
we've looked at individual routes
that you can map
in a URLconf.
What can we do
when a related group
of views
should share a common path?
Why would we want to do this?

Let's imagine you're building an educational project.
In your project,
you have schools, students, and other education related concepts.
You *could* do something like:

```python
# project/urls.py
from django.urls import path

from schools import (
    views as schools_views,
)
from students import (
    views as students_views,
)

urlpatterns = [
    path(
        "schools/", schools_views.index
    ),
    path(
        "schools/<int:school_id>/",
        schools_views.school_detail,
    ),
    path(
        "students/",
        students_views.index,
    ),
    path(
        "students/<int:student_id>/",
        students_views.student_detail,
    ),
]
```

This approach would work fine,
but it forces the root URLconf
to know about all the views defined
in each app, `schools` and `students`.
Instead,
we can use `include`
to handle this better.

```python
# project/urls.py
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path(
        "schools/",
        include("schools.urls"),
    ),
    path(
        "students/",
        include("students.urls"),
    ),
]
```

Then,
in each application,
we would have something like:

```python
# schools/urls.py
from django.urls import path

from schools import views

urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.index),
    path(
        "<int:school_id>/",
        views.school_detail
    ),
]
```

The use of `include` gives each Django app autonomy
in what views it needs to define.
The project can be blissfully "ignorant"
of what the application is doing.

Additionally,
the repetition of `schools/` or `students/` is removed
from the first example.
As Django processes a route,
it will match
on the first portion
of the route
and pass the *remainder*
onto the URLconf
that is defined in the individual app.
In this way,
URL configurations can form a tree
where the root URLconf is where all requests start,
but individual applications can handle the details
as a request is routed to the proper app.

## Naming URLs

We've looked at the main ways
that URLs get defined
with `path`, `re_path`, and `include`.
There is another aspect to consider.
How can we refer to URLs
in other places in the code?
Consider this (rather silly) view:

```python
# application/views.py
from django.http import (
    HttpResponseRedirect
)

def old_blog_categories(request):
    return HttpResponseRedirect(
        "/blog/categories/"
    )
```

A redirect is when a user tries to visit a page
and is sent somewhere else
by the browser.
There are much better ways to handle redirects
than this example shows,
but this view illustrates a different point.
What would happen if you want to restructure the project
so that blog categories moved
from `/blog/categories/`
to `/marketing/blog/categories/`?
In the current form,
we would have to fix this view
and any other view
that referenced the route directly.

What a waste of time!
Django gives us tools to give paths names
that are independent
from the explicit route.
We do this with the `name` keyword argument to `path`.

```python
# project/urls.py
from django.urls import path

from blog import views

urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path(
        "/marketing/blog/categories/",
        views.categories,
        name="blog_categories"
    ),
    ...
]
```

This gives us `blog_categories`
as an independent name
from the route
of `/marketing/blog/categories/`.
To use that name,
we need `reverse`
as its counterpart.
Our modified view looks like:

```python
# application/views.py
from django.http import (
    HttpResponseRedirect
)
from django.urls import reverse

def old_blog_categories(request):
    return HttpResponseRedirect(
        reverse("blog_categories")
    )
```

The job of `reverse`
is to look up any path name
and return its route equivalent.
That means that:

```python
reverse("blog_categories") == "/marketing/blog/categories/"
```

At least until you want to change it again. 游때

## When Names Collide

What happens
if you have multiple URLs
that you want to give the same `name`?
For instance,
`index` or `detail` are common names
that you may want to apply.
We can turn to
{{< extlink "https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" "The Zen of Python" >}}
for advice.

> **Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!**

Namespaces might be new to you
if you haven't been programming long.
They are a *shared space for names*.
Maybe that's clear,
but I recall struggling
with the concept
when I first began to write software.

To make an analogy
to something in the real world,
let's use trusty buckets.
Imagine you have two red balls
and two blue balls.
Put one ball of each color
in each of the two buckets labeled "A" and "B."
If I wanted a specific blue ball,
I can't say "please give me the blue ball"
because that would be ambiguous.
Instead,
to get a specific ball,
I would need to say "please give me the blue ball in bucket B."
In this scenario,
the bucket is the namespace.

The example that we used for schools and students
can help illustrate this idea
in code.
Both apps had an `index` view
to represent the root
of the respective portions of the project
(i.e., `schools/` and `students/`).
If we wanted to refer
to those views,
we'd try to pick the easiest choice
of `index`.
Unfortunately,
if you pick `index`,
then Django can't tell which one is the right view
for `index`.
The name is ambiguous.

One solution is to create your own namespace
by prefixing `name`
with something common
like `schools_`.
The trouble with that approach is that the URLconf repeats itself.

```python
# schools/urls.py
from django.urls import path

from schools import views

urlpatterns = [
    path(
        "",
        views.index,
        name="schools_index"
    ),
    path(
        "<int:school_id>/",
        views.school_detail,
        name="schools_detail"
    ),
]
```

Django provides an alternative
that will let you keep a shorter name.

```python
# schools/urls.py
from django.urls import path

from schools import views

app_name = "schools"
urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.index, name="index"),
    path(
        "<int:school_id>/",
        views.school_detail,
        name="detail"
    ),
]
```

By adding `app_name`,
we signal to Django
that these views are in a namespace.
Now when we want to get a URL,
we use the namespace name
and the URL name
and join them
with a colon.

```python
reverse("schools:index") == "/schools/"
```

This is another convenience
that Django gives
to make our application development experience easier.

That brings us to a close
on the subject of URLs.
By now,
we've seen how to:

* Make a URL configuration
    by making a module with a list of `urlpatterns`.
* Create URLs with `path` and `re_path`.
* Use converters to extract information for views.
* Use regular expressions to express more complex URL data.
* Group related URLs together with `include`.
* Refer to a URL by its `name`.
* Put related names together in a namespace.
