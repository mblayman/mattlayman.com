### Buy this book to learn

* The **major pieces needed** to build a Django-based website
* How the major **"batteries included" work** and why they make Django awesome
* The most **important parts outside** of Django that you'll need to be successful
* The methodology for **testing** your software to make sure it works
* Techniques for **deploying your application** live to the internet
* Philosophies on improving the **speed and security** of your site
* Strategies to apply **when things go wrong**

### Why this book?

The internet is still very quick to sell you complex solutions
for building websites.
Django is an amazing tool that gives you so much power
and lets developers build quickly.
I wrote this book to explain how Django provides this power
and how to connect that knowledge with building for the web.

What makes this book different?

With Understand Django,
I used a top-down approach to explaining website building.
We start from the common elements that you encounter when using websites,
like user interfaces and URLs.
Then we dig deeper and deeper into the other layers
that Django provides
that hide beneath the surface.

This style lets you progressively discover how Django works
without forcing you to understand abstract pieces
that don't fit into your mental model yet.

### This book is for you if you...

* Have basic **Python experience**
* Know other languages and want to see **how Python on the web is done**
* Want to understand how a web framework **really** works
* Desire to **build the tools** in your web toolbox
* Like to roll up your sleeves and **get into code**
* Need a **wide overview** of developing on the web
* Want to be a **better developer**

### Readers are saying...

> Although this could be a first book, it is far more useful to someone who has already worked with Django - then this book can be better appreciated for the tightly packed bits of extremely useful information. I found the "direct to the point" writing style refreshing. Each chapter gets down to the practical advice and techniques as quickly as possible.
