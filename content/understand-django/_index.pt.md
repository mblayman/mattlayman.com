Understand Django walks you through the Django web framework
and explores many of the features available in Django.

We start from the top at an exploration of the browser and the layers
that make the internet work, then dig deep down through the framework
to reveal how you can make web applications using Django.

By the time you finish reading Understand Django,
you'll have a much deeper knowledge of how web applications work
and, specifically,
how _Python-based_ web applications are built.

You can read the book online for _free, right now,_
and soon will be able to able to buy an e-book, physical book,
or audio book from your favorite online stores.

The content builds
on itself
to increase your understanding
of how to use Django
and explains how Django works.
If you're new to Django,
you can start
from the beginning.
The book assumes you have little or no prior knowledge
of doing web development.

Let's get started!
