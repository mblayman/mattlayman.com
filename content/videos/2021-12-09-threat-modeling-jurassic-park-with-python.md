title: "Threat Modeling Jurassic Park with Python"
description: "How would John Hammond design the systems on Isla Nublar in 2021? Would he spare no expense to reduce risk of a disaster? We hope that his software engineers would employ the concept of threat modeling, one of the most important security skills in modern software development. Corey will give an overview of what threat modeling is, and how to use it to highlight security concerns early on in the SDLC. This will lead into a demonstration of using pytm, a Pythonic framework for threat modeling, to identify threats to Jurassic Park's systems within your favorite Python IDE."
