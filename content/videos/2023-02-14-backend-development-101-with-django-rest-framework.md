title: "Backend Development 101 with Django REST Framework"
description: "If you're familiar with Python, you've most certainly heard of Django, but may not know what it is used for and why people like it so much. We will first run through a 'backend development 101' crash-course, then talk about Django's take on backend development and what Django REST Framework provides on top of it. Finally we will add a feature to an example Django app and do some live coding."

If you're familiar with Python, you've most certainly heard of Django, but may not know what it is used for and why people like it so much. We will first run through a 'backend development 101' crash-course, then talk about Django's take on backend development and what Django REST Framework provides on top of it. Finally we will add a feature to an example Django app and do some live coding.

This was presented at Python Frederick by David Wolgemuth.
The audio on the recording was low, but the content is good if you're willing to crank up your speakers for this one.
