title: "Post-launch Punchlist - Building SaaS #186"
description: "In this episode, we had a bunch of issues to resolve post-launch. I set the code that causes trials to expire, made updates to who receives prompt emails, and added some polish to the sign up process and interface to make it clear what will happen in the flow. After those modifications, we worked through a set of smaller changes like setting up Dependabot and adding a missing database index."
