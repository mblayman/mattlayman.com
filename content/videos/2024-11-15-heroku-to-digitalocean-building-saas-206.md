description: "In this episode, I began a migration of my JourneyInbox app from Heroku to DigitalOcean. The first step to this move, since I'm going to use Kamal, is to put the app into a Docker image. We got the whole app into the Docker image, then cleaned up local development and the CI system after making changes that broke those configurations."
