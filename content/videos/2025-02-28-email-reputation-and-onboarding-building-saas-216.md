title: "Email Reputation and Onboarding - Building SaaS #216"
description: "In this episode, I did checking on the email reputation of my SaaS apps because I got feedback from a customer that my emails were going to spam. Along the way, we learned about DMARC as a capability to track and report on email compliance. After making some DNS changes to enable DMARC, I worked on some onboarding changes for my homeschool application. We are going to simplify the onboarding flow so that users have a faster path to success with the app."
