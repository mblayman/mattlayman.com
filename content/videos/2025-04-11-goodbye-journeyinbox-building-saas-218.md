description: "In this episode, I declared to the stream that I'm done working on JourneyInbox as a SaaS product. I didn't see any meaningful market adoption, so I've decided to pivot the project to serve only my personal needs. I used the stream to do a retrospective on the project and then convert the core logic to use Go to simplify when I need to run on my server."

In this episode, I declared to the stream that I'm done working on JourneyInbox as a SaaS product. I didn't see any meaningful market adoption, so I've decided to pivot the project to serve only my personal needs. I used the stream to do a retrospective on the project and then convert the core logic to use Go to simplify when I need to run on my server.
