Within the last month,
I've joined a new company.
I'm now a senior software engineer
at [Doctor on Demand](https://doctorondemand.com/).
This is my first foray
into a healthcare company
so I'm excited about all the new things
that I'll be exposed to.

Doctor on Demand is a leader
in telemedicine.
The service brings doctors directly to patients
via video calls.
These doctors are able to diagnose
and prescribe treatment
for many of the common health problems
that primary care providers usually see.
By meeting over video calls,
patients are seen far faster
than going on a trip to their local physician.

Working on a service
that augments patient care
is pretty amazing!
I like knowing
that my work will help families connect
with doctors
as medical problems arise.

Specifically,
my job is on the backend team
where I will write business logic
using Django.
With four years of experience with Django from Storybird,
I think I'm well equipped
to make a strong contribution
to the new team.

On the flip side,
I'm so thankful
for the time that I had
at [Storybird](https://storybird.com/).
I loved working
with a team
that cared deeply
about inspiring kids
to write.

My time at Storybird grew me
in many ways.

* I learned a ton about building web applications
  that serve massive amounts of people.
* I experienced what it's like to lead a team
  of developers.
* I saw how the sausage is made
  in the life of a startup.

I'm humbled knowing
that (literally!) millions
of students used Storybird
during my time there.
Not everyone gets an opportunity
to have so much impact,
so I'm totally grateful
for the experience.

This is the beginning
of a new chapter in my life.
The new job has me learning new code
and new processes.
I'm meeting new people
and forging new relationships.
Additionally,
my son begins kindergarten
in the fall
so there will be even more change coming
as this new phase of life begins.

I'm looking forward to the challenge.
