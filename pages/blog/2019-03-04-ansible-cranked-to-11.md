title: "Ansible Cranked to 11"
description: >-
   On last week's Twitch stream,
   I added Mitogen
   to my Ansible deploy,
   and it dramatically improved how fast
   I could deploy to my site.

On the [Building SaaS with Python and Django](https://www.twitch.tv/mblayman) Twitch stream,
I tried out a new tool
to see if it would improve my deploy time.
We configured Ansible to use [Mitogen](https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ansible.html)
and it was an incredible success.

**With Mitogen, the Ansible deploy was 4.5X faster!**
Check out the YouTube video
to watch how quickly we could get Mitogen going.
