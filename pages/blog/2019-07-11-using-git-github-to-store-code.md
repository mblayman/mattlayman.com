For Python Frederick's July presentation,
I presented on Git and GitHub
for beginners
who have never used either
of those tools before.

In the presentation,
I explained the core concepts
of Git
and demonstrated how to use Git
with Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
We covered why you would use Git
and how you would use it
to work with other people.

The demonstration also used GitHub
to create a repository
for a code project.
We looked at a couple
of methods
of sharing code
between people,
including directly committing
to a shared repository
and working with Pull Requests.

The recording from the talk is available
on YouTube.
