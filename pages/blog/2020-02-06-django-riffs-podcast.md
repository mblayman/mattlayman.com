I've started a podcast!
The podcast is called Django Riffs,
and my goal is to help beginners learn
how to use [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).
You can find the show on
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1RtdveQIz5m5MqLKPWbhnD)
or check Apple Podcasts
or wherever you get podcasts.

Each episode of the podcast will be a topical exploration
of one facet
of the Django web framework.
With many years
of Django under my belt,
I believe I have the experience
to help beginners
on their journey into learning Django.
More experienced Djangonauts may benefit
from a refresher
on the subjects
that we cover.

With this launch announcement,
I am releasing the first two episodes.

* The first episode,
    [Get To Know Django](/django-riffs/get-to-know-django),
    gets us situated
    with where Django exists
    in the context
    of the internet
    and web application development.
* In the second episode,
    [Enter With URLs](/django-riffs/enter-with-urls),
    we start our exploration
    of Django's features
    by focusing on how Django sets up URLs.

These episodes take quite a while to produce
because of the research, preparation, and production
of each one.
My aim is to get out a new show every couple
of weeks if I can.

If you would like,
you can follow the show
on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1RtdveQIz5m5MqLKPWbhnD).
Or follow me or the show
on X
at [@mblayman](https://x.com/mblayman)
or [@djangoriffs](https://x.com/djangoriffs).

I hope you enjoy this.
Please feel free to reach out to me
with comments or feedback.
My mission is to make a great Django learning experience
for new developers
and grow the Django community.
