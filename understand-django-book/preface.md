# Preface

Let's get right into this.
What is this book and who is it for?

This is a book about the Django web framework.
If you've grabbed this book,
I suspect that you've heard a little bit about Django
and maybe know that Django does "web stuff"
in Python.
My goal with Understand Django is take you
from knowing virtually nothing about Django
and web development
to having a mental model
of how Django works,
so that you can use Django yourself
and build something cool
on the internet.

Understand Django is structured
in a top-down style.
We start with the overall goal of building a website.
From that high level goal,
each chapter digs deeper into the layers
that Django offers
to expand your understanding
of what it means to make a full application
on the web.
If I've done my job well,
you'll be able to connect how each new piece
of information
fits into the ultimate objective
of making a web application.

Who is the ideal reader
for this content?
To me,
the ideal reader for this book is someone
with a working knowledge of Python,
but is unfamiliar with web development.
Maybe that means you're a data scientist
who is trying to put your analysis to work
into a web app.
Or maybe you're hardware hobbyist
that want to build your own app
to surface information about devices
in your home.
Whoever you are,
I think Understand Django can give you a much deeper understanding
of how things are built on the internet.

Notice that I set an expectation
of working knowledge of Python.
This is important
because this book is not an introduction to programming.
I assume that you understand what variables are,
how imports work,
and other core aspects of Python itself.
If these are foreign concepts to you,
then you may not find the material in this book approachable.
Simultaneously,
I don't expect you to be a Python wizard.
We're not getting into meta-programming
or any of Python's more esoteric features.

My ultimate goal with Understand Django is
to make this web framework more accessible
to people with all kind of experiences and goals.

## About the Cover

I produced the cover of this book
using [DALLÂ·E](https://labs.openai.com/)
from OpenAI.

Why is the robot playing a guitar?
I selected a robot playing an acoustic guitar
for a couple of reasons.

* Django is named after [Django Reinhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt),
  a well-known jazz guitarist.
* During the authoring of this book,
  I picked up acoustic guitar as my first instrument ever
  and started on my journey
  to understand the world of music through the guitar.

I hope this little bit of silliness
of a toy robot playing guitar put a smile
on your face.

Now, let's learn about Django!
