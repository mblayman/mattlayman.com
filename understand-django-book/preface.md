# Preface

This is a placeholder.
I'm going to use this to jot down ideas suggested
by beta readers,
then write this much later in the process.

* Explain my philosophy of teaching
* Expected prereqs
  * Python knowledge
  * Rudimentary understanding of Python type hints. Link to a type hint reference material.

## About the Cover

I produced the cover of this book
using [DALLÂ·E](https://labs.openai.com/)
from OpenAI.

Why is the robot playing a guitar?
I selected a robot playing an acoustic guitar
for a couple of reasons.

* Django is named after [Django Reinhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt),
  a well-known jazz guitarist.
* During the authoring of this book,
  I picked up acoustic guitar as my first instrument ever
  and started on my journey
  to understand the world of music through the guitar.

I hope this little bit of silliness
of a toy robot playing guitar put a smile
on your face.

Now, let's learn about Django!
